# Mandlebrot
This program, with the help of graphics.py (implemented by John Zell), generates the famous mandlebrot set. The image is generated by examining the behaivoir of a complex number, when subjected to a specific iterative process (refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
I began this program by implementing a complex number object which is named 'Complex'. This code can be found in the file 'Complex.py'. This object defines a few instance methods which make it easier to work with complex numbers mathematically.
In the file 'iterator.py' I have defined the ComplexSeq object which creates a sequence of all the complex numbers that occur when a given complex number is put under iteration ( f(z) = z^2 +c ).The ComplexSeq object can also generate a list of objects which can be displayed with the graphics.py API.
