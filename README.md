# Mandlebrot
This program, with the help of graphics.py (John Zell), generates the famous mandlebrot set. A formal description of the mandlebrot set can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set. I might also advise watching Numberphile's video on the topic at https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=numberphile+mandelbrot+set&docid=608033559610398598&mid=2DB715A44ADE2EC8C6E52DB715A44ADE2EC8C6E5&view=detail&FORM=VIRE
This program can:
  1. render the mandlebrot set
  2. visualize the movement of a complex number when said number is put under the iterative function that defines the mandlebrot set
  3. renders the filled Julia set at some point which the user clicks on.
