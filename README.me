This program, with the help of graphics.py (John Zell), generates the famous mandlebrot set.
A formal description of the mandlebrot set can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set. 
I might also advise watching Numberphile's video on the topic at https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=numberphile+mandelbrot+set&docid=608033559610398598&mid=2DB715A44ADE2EC8C6E52DB715A44ADE2EC8C6E5&view=detail&FORM=VIRE

Functionality:

    render_set()
    -Given an origon 'org', a max distance from origon 'span' and a window size 'size',
    the program tests (and if possible renders) every complex number which is |span|
    distance away from org within a size x size window

    render_chain()
    -User can click on some point on the rendered mandelbrot set and visualize the path
    which the complex number at the clicked point will follow when put under iteration

    render_julia_set()
    --User can click on some complex number on the rendered image, and in a new window
    julia set associated with said complex number will be rendered
    

v4 notes
-MandlebroWindow can now render the mandelbrot set with any complex number as its origon point
-Methods which deal with Complex <-> Point conversions have been adjusted to support
new MandlebrotWindow origon parameter. See iterator.py for details
-When the user renders a julia set, the point on the mandelbrot set associated with the julia set
is now marked in yellow and blue

v3 notes
-mandlebrot.py functionality transferred to Display.py, which implements the MandlebrotWindow ADT. This new ADT makes the render more size adjustable
-MandlebrotWindow takes window size as a parameter, sets the width and height of GraphWin ADT
-MandlebrotWindow takes span as a parameter, span sets the render distance from origon ex. span = 2 -> render all c in Complex such that c.real in [-2,2] and c.img in [2,-2].
-Julia set is now colored, return type for ComplexSeq.in_julia_set changed from bool to (bool, color)


Todo:
    1. implement O(1) color picking function

    2. create a function which finds a resolution that will render the
    same density of points given any span

    3 zoom()
        -user clicks a point and in a new window a zoomed in render of the set is created
        -user specified magnification factor
        -zoom supports up to n clicks. first click creates new window, additional
        clicks overwrites previous zoom render
        -this function will depened on a consistent render density, so task 2 must be implemeneted before zoom
